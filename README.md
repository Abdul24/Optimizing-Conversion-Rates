< b> Optimizing Conversion Rates</b> <br>

This notebook details the approaches and the recommendations of Project Outreach which aims to optimize conversion rates for a website.


<b>This notebook covers:</b>
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Exploration
3. Model Building
4. Recommendations


<b>Approach:</b>
1. Our approach is once we cleaned the data we use a classification model as a feature significance tool.
2. Once we are able to narrow down to the most descriptive features, we do deep dives into these features and extract exact recommendations for each feature where we could optimize the conversion.

<b>Recommendations:</b>
1. The number of pages that a user sees is incredibly predictive of the conversion rate, so the website's focus should be increasing the likelihood that a user will see another page.
2. More specifically, the # of pages that will significantly increase conversion is 9 - 15 pages where we get the most gains on the conversion rate.
3. Create incentives within the site for the user to keep clicking and to engage with the site. Do sweepstakes, promos, sales, etc.
4. Investigate why there were 2 data points with users that had ages of over 100 years.

<b>Next Steps:</b>
1. I would be interested in getting more granular data on a user's path throughout the website. Maybe there are certain pages that convert users more than others. Doing an analysis of the sequence of interactions of a user will allow for a deeper understanding of what makes people convert.
